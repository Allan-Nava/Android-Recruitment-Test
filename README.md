# Android Recruitment Test

Throught JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) build Android Application that allow user to perform CRUD operations, considering that rendering and retrieval of the list support hugely large number of posts.

Use the /comments resources provided by JSONPlaceholder to render the comments of a post below it on click with some kind of animation.

Insert in the Readme file, documentation relating to the work done (ES: How to launch the application, Development pattern used...)

It is very important to document the progress of the work by updating the project whenever significant changes are made.

Extimated time job: 1 week from fork.

## Extra Challenge

Instead to use JSONPlaceholder API use your own Rest API.
